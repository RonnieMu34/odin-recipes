                <ol>
                    <li> <strong class="step-titles">Prepare the tea: </strong> Steep the tea bags or leaves with 4 cups
                        of freshly boiled water. Allow tea to sit in the water until it cools completely</li> <br>
                    <li> <strong class="step-titles">Prepare the simple syrup (if using): </strong> Add the water and
                        sugar to a saucepan and quickly stir everything together.<br> Heat the water on medium-high and
                        cook until the water boils and the sugar ompletely dissolves. <br> Remove the saucepan from heat
                        and let the simple syrup cool before transferring to a jar.</li> <br>
                    <li> <strong class="step-titles">Cook the tapioca pearls: </strong> Bring about 4 cups of water to
                        boil and add the tapioca pearls.<br> Stir the pearls and wait for them to float to the top.<br>
                        Then, cook them for another 5 minutes. Test a pearl to see if it has reached the desired level
                        of softness.<br> Cook the pearls for another few minutes if they are still stiff.<br> Use a
                        slotted spoon to remove the pearls from the hot water.<br> Quickly rinse the pearls with water.
                        Transfer the pearls into a bowl, and mix the pearls with a few tablespoons of simple syrup (to
                        taste).</li> <br>
                    <li> <strong class="step-titles">Assemble the drinks: </strong> Strain the tea into a pitcher.<br>
                        Divide the cooked tapioca pearls into 4 large glasses. Next, add a few ice cubes to each
                        glass.<br> Pour 1 cup of the tea into each glass. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of milk and 1 1/2
                        tablespoons of simple syrup into each glass.<br> Stir and taste the milk tea. Add more milk or
                        simple syrup to your taste.</li> <br>
                    <li> <strong class="step-titles">If you are serving the beverage to guests: </strong> have a small
                        pitcher of milk and the jar of simple syrup ready so that each guest can adjust their drinks to
                        their taste.<br> The drink is usually served with large boba straws (large enough for the
                        tapioca pearls to go through).<br> If you don’t have the straws on hand, you can use spoons to
                        scoop out the tapioca pearls</li> <br>
